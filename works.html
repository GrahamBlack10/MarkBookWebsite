                <h1>"KNOXATE"</h1>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The drug, Knoxate, has many beneficial therapeutic effects but at a high dose, it causes a
                    hypnotic-like effect. The subject becomes very susceptible to what is being said around them.
                    <br><br>
                    The drug company that is developing Knoxate is called Knox Pharmaceuticals and is run by Dr Jane
                    Porrima and Dr Ian Cowliss. They are trying to develop the drug in clinical trials for Alzheimer's
                    disease but are aggressively pursued by not only another larger biotech but also by other factions
                    interested only in self-promotion. Jane is the leader and CEO, while Ian is the quitter scientific
                    genius. These two together with Jose the Parker Pen-wielding assassin, when need be, fight off the
                    interlopers and defend the company from multiple foes.
                    <br><br>
                    In the latter section of the book, the team gets targeted by the government, and the erratic,
                    irascible, and dangerous President Frump (I am open to changing the name) has some crazy schemes
                    that need to be dealt with. The scheme the President wants to engage in if he is re-elected is the
                    formation of a water border along the entire US southern border. He intends to bomb a channel from
                    California to Texas. This information about President Frump's future plans is fortuitously garnered
                    while under the influence of Knoxate. Jane and Ian decided they could not let this happen. They
                    engage the scientists who work at Knox Pharmaceuticals to change the course of a US election for the
                    sake of mankind.

                    <br>
                    <h3>"A collection of humorous stories about medical cases encountered while riding a village
                        ambulance." </h3>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Furst Aid. - Chapter 1: Bilton</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Richard Furst leaned back in his chair and put his hands behind his head. The last call had been
                        intense, and he wanted to write his chart accurately. He took pride in his work and wanted to
                        get what had happened down while it was still fresh in his memory. He closed his eyes and moved
                        his hands down from his head and rested them on his large belly. Rich Furst was a large portly
                        man in his 50's, his hair was grey and thinning and the once tall and athletic figure was now
                        very soft around the edges. His wife Vera said she liked his love handles and these gave her
                        something to hold onto, but Rich was embarrassed about his weight. Rich had tried to diet many
                        times, but he loved food too much and usually gave up quickly. His job was one where he
                        sometimes had to eat because he didn't know when he would next get the chance to eat, or after
                        eating he would be sat around for long periods. He sat forward, leaned to one side farted
                        “pffffffffft” and started to write. Rich had a problem with gas, most likely due to the large
                        amounts of fast food he ate, and gas left his body at an extraordinary pace. He sometimes was
                        embarrassed about the sounds he made and got mad when people snickered at him, but he could not
                        help himself. If he held it in it gave him pain. He was happy when he was all alone and could
                        fart as much as he wanted. As he was finishing the chart, he heard his partner Peter arriving,
                        he quickly farted “pffffffffft” and continued typing.

                    <h3>Chapter 2: Naked Sandwich</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Andi: “Station 99 Rescue respond Pleasant Valley Motel, intoxicated female causing a
                        disturbance, head wound.”
                        <br><br>
                        Oh my god I could listen to her for days, her voice is soo hot. Pete was stood looking at the
                        speaker on the wall.
                        <br><br>
                        “Come on Pete”, the chief put on his jacket and headed toward the ambulance bay.
                        <br><br>
                        “Another god damn drunk” Peter groaned, “I had the last one, this time I drive and you hold the
                        puke bag”.
                        <br><br>
                        “Fine, move your butt”. The chief always responded promptly to any call no matter what. He saw
                        it as his duty to help anybody no matter what the call. He didn't judge anybody, there was just
                        simply something deep down in him that loved to help people.
                        Pete climbed in the driver seat, called dispatch on the radio to say there were responding,
                        opened the bay door, hit the lights and sirens, shortly thereafter flooring the accelerator.
                        The Pleasant Valley Motel was anything other than pleasant it was seedy, cheap and often
                        inhabited by the strangest people in the area. In its heyday the Pleasant Valley was quite nice
                        and quaint. The motel was semicircular in nature with all of the rooms having a view of the
                        pool. The pool however hadn't seen a bather in years as what was left of the water was green and
                        putrid. The “landscaping” around the pool was overgrown with weeds that simply served to catch
                        the trash. The rooms of the motel hadn't had a fresh coat of paint in years and all the carpets
                        and bedlinens had seen better days. The rooms smelt of mold, cigarettes, and body odor. No
                        matter how much the room was cleaned the room still smelled stale to Billy the manager had given
                        up years ago. The sort of clientele that came to Pleasant Valley were those being helped by the
                        state on welfare or truckers on the way through looking for a cheap bed or the night, often
                        including easy access to the local drug circuit. The EMS squad along with local law enforcement
                        knew the motel very well. Most calls from dispatch to the Pleasant Valley motel were met with
                        groans even when they were delivered by Andi and her sultry undertones.

                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Andi: “Station 99 Rescue respond to 22 Main Street, 81-year-old female altered mental status.
                        Patrol is on location.”
                        <br><br>
                        Ryan was in the radio room just finishing up some reports when the call came in. He jumped up
                        immediately and paused when he got to the back of the rig. “mmmhh I wonder of the Chief will let
                        me drive?” he thought. He decided to chance it and went towards the driver's side. Ryan loved
                        the adrenaline of driving to a call. The lights, sirens and sheer rush of responding had quickly
                        become a drug he could not do without.
                        <br><br>
                        The Chief was inspecting one of the ambulances in the back of the bay, when the alarm went off.
                        “Altered mental status” he thought. When this term was used it meant a change from that person's
                        normal way of behaving. When this term was applied to an elderly person it could mean anything,
                        but stroke was one thing the chief would be looking for or rule out. He quickly moved to the rig
                        on active duty. As did so he saw Ryan pause behind the rig and pause, then move towards the
                        driver's side. The chief smiled. He was so proud of Ryan. When this kid had come to him, he had
                        no direction and was always itching to do something wrong. Now he was a dedicated EMT and full
                        of enthusiasm. Sometimes the chief had to curb the enthusiasm for the sake of everybody around
                        him, but this was one of many reasons why he loved his job; he made a difference in people's
                        lives. He had already decided to promote Ryan to team lead he just hadn't told him yet. He
                        wanted the kid to wait just a little longer and give the kid time to work on his patience. He
                        moved towards the passenger side door of the ambulance and got in. “Chief OK if I drive?” Ryan
                        looked at the Chief with wide eyes. “Just drive, but not too fast we save lives but do not cause
                        accidents OK” the chief growled. Ryan hit the light and sirens and they went. Along the ride the
                        Chief silently noted that Ryan was driving well, he got on scene in good time but safely. The 2
                        men exited the vehicle at 22 main street. The first thing to ascertain was what was actually
                        going on as they entered the residence they heard “you're trying to rape me, go away”. The Chief
                        motioned for Ryan to take charge and go in first.
